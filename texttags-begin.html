HTML

HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create Web pages.

HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like &lt;html&gt;). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
